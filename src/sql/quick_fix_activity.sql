-- Quick fix for immediate testing
-- This updates all existing clients to have updated_at = created_at so they show some activity

-- First add the column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now();

-- Update existing records to have updated_at = created_at
UPDATE clients 
SET updated_at = created_at 
WHERE updated_at IS NULL;

-- Create the trigger function and trigger for future updates
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = now();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_clients_updated_at ON clients;
CREATE TRIGGER update_clients_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON clients
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

-- Update the client_activity view to include client created/updated dates
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW client_activity AS
